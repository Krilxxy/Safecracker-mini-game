Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the extracted directory using:

cd path/to/SafeCrackerGame

Build the project by running:

dotnet build

Once the build process is complete, run the game using:

dotnet run


The game itself has some issues which I couldn't seem to be able to fix myself, as it would require additional time for debugging and maybe altering the logic.
